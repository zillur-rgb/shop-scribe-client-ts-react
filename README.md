## Overview

Create my [Shoppingify](https://shoppingify.shop/) app. Use any front-end libraries of your choice. Create your API. Don’t look at the existing solution.

### User-Stories

- User story: When I select the items tab, I can see a list of items under different categories.
- User story: I can add a new item with name, category, note, and image.
- User story: When I add a new item, I can select one from the existing categories or add a new one if the category does not exist
- User story: When I select an item, I can see its details and I can choose to add the current list or delete the item.
- User story: I can add items to the current list
- User story: I can increase the number of item in the list
- User story: I can remove the item from the list
  User story: I can save/update the list with a name (user can have only one active list at a time)
- User story: I can toggle between editing state and completing state
- User story: When I am at completing state, I can save my progress by selecting the item
- User story: I can cancel the active list
- User story: When I try to cancel a list, I can see a confirmation notification
- User story: I can see my shopping history and I can see the details of it
- User story: I can see some statistics: top items, top categories, and monthly comparison. (Tips: use libraries like recharts for the graph)
- User story (optional): I can search for items

### The-challenges

- The task includes creatiom of frontend of the Shoppingify. I was able to fulfill all the user stories.
- But there are so many things to handle, I was overwhelmed once.
- I could have use any CSS Framework, it would save tons of the time but now-a-days I am exploring vanilla css therefore tried with vanilla css.
- Using reducer was the most challenging part also interesting because there are a lot of things I have learned.
- I have used Date-fns library before but this time I had to dig deep because there are quite a lot of stuffs related to Date time.

### Built with

- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- Reducer
- date-fns
- Reacharts

### What I learned

- Of course, for the first time managed state using reducer. There was a lot of learning.
- Beside that, I used Yup and Formik for form and validation. It was also interesting.

### Continued development

- So many things I have plan to work with, among them I need to define types properly.
- There are still few bugs that needs to go away.
- I will transform this to a fullstack project.
- Also, I will add user authentication.
